Color SSH, `csh` for short, is a Rust-based wrapper for `ssh` that provides syntax-highlighted output using configurable rules. This tool enhances the usability of SSH by allowing regex-based syntax highlighting for specific text patterns in the output.

## Features

- **Regex-based Syntax Highlighting**: Match and highlight specific patterns in SSH output using configurable regex rules.
- **Customizable Colors**: Define colors for each rule using RGB hex codes.
- **Configurable Rules**: Use a YAML configuration file to add and manage highlighting rules dynamically.
- **Multi-line Regex Support**: Supports free-spacing regex for complex matching needs.
- **Simple Integration**: Works seamlessly with `ssh` as a drop-in replacement.

## Installation

### [Install using Latest Github Release](https://github.com/karsyboy/color-ssh/releases/)

### Install using Cargo

```bash
cargo install color-ssh
```

### Install using Github Source (Testing & Development)
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/karsyboy/color-ssh.git
   cd color-ssh
   ```

2. Build the project:
   ```bash
   cargo build --release
   ```

3. Install the binary (optional):
   ```bash
   cp target/release/csh /usr/local/bin/
   ```

---

## Usage

### Basic Syntax
```bash
A Rust-based SSH client with syntax highlighting.

Usage: csh [OPTIONS] <ssh_args>...

Arguments:
  <ssh_args>...  SSH arguments

Options:
  -d, --debug    Enable debug mode
  -L, --log      Enable SSH logging
  -h, --help     Print help
  -V, --version  Print version
```

### Example
```bash
csh user@hostname
```

This runs an SSH session while applying the syntax highlighting rules defined in `.csh-config.yaml`.

---

## Configuration
The configuration file is expected to be stored either in the users home directory under `.csh\.csh-config.yaml` or in the current directory the `csh`  binary tool is being ran out of.

Valid Configuration file locations:
- `$HOME/.csh/.csh-config.yaml`
- `$PWD/.csh-config.yaml`

The syntax highlighting rules are defined in a YAML file. Each rule consists of:
- **`description`**: A human-readable explanation of what the rule does.
- **`regex`**: The pattern to match in SSH output.
- **`color`**: The color to apply, specified as a key from the `palette` section.

### Example Configuration (`.csh-config.yaml`)
```yaml
# Description: This is the default template created by color-ssh (csh). 
# It contains information on the template layout and how to create a custom template.
# color-ssh templates can be found at https://github.com/karsyboy/color-ssh

# The palette section is used to define the colors that can be used in the rules section.
# The colors are defined in hex format.
palette:
  Red: '#c71800'
  Green: '#28c501'
  Blue: '#5698c8'

rules:
# example rule with all possible options
# - description: Match on the word "example"
#   regex: |
#     (?ix)
#       \b
#       example
#       \b
#   color: Kelly-Green
# create a rule that matches on the word "connected" or "up" and color it Kelly-Green

# Example of a rule that uses a one line regex to match on "good" or "up" and color it Green
- description: Match on good keywords
  regex: (?ix)\b(good|up)\b
  color: Green


- description: Match on neutral keywords
  regex: |
    (?ix)
      \b
      neutral
      \b
  color: Blue

# create a rule that matches on the word "down" or "error" or "disabled" and color it Red
- description: Match on bad keywords
  regex: |
    (?ix)
      \b
      (down|error|disabled)
      \b
  color: Red
```

### Explanation of Configuration
1. **Palette**:
   - The `palette` section defines reusable colors using hex codes (e.g., `#32cd32` for green).
2. **Rules**:
   - Each rule includes a description, regex, and a reference to a color in the `palette`.

## Logging 
The `.csh` folder is also used to stored ssh logs if the `-L or --log` argument is used. Logs will be stored in `.csh/ssh-logs/MM-DD-YYYY/HOSTNAME-MM-DD-YYYY.log`

---

## How It Works

1. **Regex Matching**:
   - The script processes SSH output chunk by chunk, applying each regex rule to match patterns.
2. **ANSI Escape Codes**:
   - Matches are wrapped with ANSI escape codes for colors based on the palette.
3. **Dynamic Configuration**:
   - Rules and colors can be updated by modifying the YAML config file without changing the code.

## Future Improvements

- Add vault functionality 
  - `csh-vault.yaml` encrypted file for storing host information like passwords used to connect.
  - File with be encrypted with quantum computer resistance encryption methods.
  - Feature to unlock csh which spawns a csh process that has the ability to decrypt the `csh-vault.yaml` after the users provides there unlock password.
  - and many more features around this...
- Add support for themes or predefined configurations.
